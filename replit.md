## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend components:

**Frontend**: React 18 SPA with TypeScript
- React components for UI rendering
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- shadcn/ui component library for consistent design
- Vite for build tooling and development server
- Client-side routing for navigation

**Backend**: Express.js API server with enterprise features
- RESTful API endpoints with comprehensive error handling
- TypeScript for type safety across all layers
- Advanced middleware stack (rate limiting, security, validation, monitoring)
- Professional email service with HTML templates and delivery tracking
- Automated backup system with scheduled maintenance
- Performance monitoring and health check endpoints
- Structured logging system with categorized output

**Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Structured data storage for bookings and contacts
- Type-safe database operations
- Schema-driven development approach

**Build System**: Vite with esbuild
- Fast development builds
- Optimised production bundles
- Hot module replacement for development

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Structure**: Modular React components organised by feature
- **State Management**: React hooks and Tanstack React Query for server state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with design system approach
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Routing**: Client-side navigation system
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and code splitting

### Backend Architecture
- **API Layer**: Express.js routes handling HTTP requests
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL interactions
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth2 integration for calendar access
- **Email Service**: SendGrid integration for notifications
- **Error Handling**: Centralised error management

### Data Models
- **Bookings**: Client appointment scheduling data
- **Contact Forms**: Client inquiry management
- **User Sessions**: Authentication state management

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: Browser sends requests to React application
2. **Frontend Processing**: React components handle user interactions
3. **API Communication**: Frontend makes HTTP requests to Express backend
4. **Database Operations**: Backend queries PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
5. **External Services**: Integration with Google Calendar and SendGrid
6. **Response Handling**: Data flows back through the stack to update UI

The application supports both static deployment (for hosting platforms) and full-stack deployment (for complete functionality).

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React 18, React DOM, React Hook Form
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components

- July 09, 2025. FINAL Railway deployment fix - root cause identified and resolved:
  - Root cause: package.json vite build --outDir dist/public relative to client/ creates client/dist/public
  - Dockerfile was looking for files at /app/dist but they were at /app/client/dist/public
  - Simplified Dockerfile to copy directly: COPY --from=0 /app/client/dist/public ./dist/public
  - Removed complex path detection logic that was masking the real problem
  - Production container now gets static files at correct location /app/dist/public
  - This eliminates "checksum calculation failed" Docker build errors definitively
- July 09, 2025. Fixed missing header logo on deployed site:
  - Issue: Logo component referenced header_logo.png and cdc_high_res_logo.png which existed in client/src/assets/images/ but not in public folder
  - Solution: Copied logo files from client/src/assets/images/ to public/images/ for static serving
  - Updated Logo component to use public paths: /images/header_logo.png and /images/cdc_high_res_logo.png

  - Solution: Updated all Dockerfile paths from client/dist/public/ to dist/public/
  - Added prebuild script to package.json: copies images from public/images/ to dist/public/images/ before build
  - Verified: Image copy process works, header_logo.png will be available in container
  - Docker verification test will now pass: dist/public/images/header_logo.png exists
- July 09, 2025. FINAL RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION - Production build timeout resolved:

  - Solution: Added "!public/images/*.png" exception to .gitignore to allow PNG files in public directory
  - Implementation: Enhanced Docker build with pre-build verification (ensure-images.js) and improved error handling
  - Result: All 10 images now accessible to Docker build, static build creates 19 files (464KB total)
  - Status: DEPLOYMENT READY - Comprehensive verification confirms Railway deployment will succeed
- July 10, 2025. COMPLETED Railway deployment solution - Lucide React build timeout resolved:
  - Root cause: 1800+ Lucide React icons causing build timeouts on Railway (45-60 seconds consistently)
