# Push to Your New GitHub Repository

## Current Situation:
- Your Replit is connected to: `https://github.com/THOMARSE5150/cdc-replit-jarvis.git`
- Your new empty repo: `https://github.com/THOMARSE5150/cdc-jarvis.git`
- Need to switch the connection to your new repo

## Method 1: Use Replit's Version Control (Recommended)

### Step 1: Disconnect Current Repository
1. In Replit, click the **Version Control** icon (git branch icon) in the left sidebar
2. Click the **three dots menu** → **Settings** 
3. Click **"Disconnect from GitHub"** or **"Change Repository"**

### Step 2: Connect to New Repository
1. Click **"Connect to GitHub"**
2. Authorize Replit to access your GitHub if prompted
3. Select your repository: **THOMARSE5150/cdc-jarvis**
4. Choose **"Import from GitHub"** or **"Connect to existing repo"**

### Step 3: Push Your Code
1. In the Version Control panel, you should see all your files listed
2. Add a commit message like: "Initial commit - Railway-ready mental health counselling app"
3. Click **"Commit & Push"**

## Method 2: Manual Git Commands (If Method 1 Fails)

If the Replit interface doesn't work, you can manually change the repository:

### Step 1: Remove Git Lock Files
```bash
rm -f .git/config.lock .git/index.lock
```

### Step 2: Change Remote URL
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/THOMARSE5150/cdc-jarvis.git
```

### Step 3: Stage and Commit Files
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Railway-ready counselling app"
```

### Step 4: Push to New Repository
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Files Being Pushed:
✅ Complete React application with counselling services
✅ Railway-optimized Dockerfile
✅ Production server (start-server.js)
✅ Railway configuration (railway.json)
✅ All dependencies and build files
✅ SEO-optimized content and mobile-responsive design

## After Successful Push:
1. Your code will be at: https://github.com/THOMARSE5150/cdc-jarvis
2. Go to Railway.app
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select "THOMARSE5150/cdc-jarvis"
5. Railway will automatically detect and deploy using your Dockerfile

## Verification:
Once pushed, your GitHub repo should contain:
- React application files
- server/ directory with backend code
- Dockerfile and railway.json
- package.json with all dependencies
- Built static files in dist/public/

Try Method 1 first using Replit's interface - it's the most reliable approach!
