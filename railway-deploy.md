# Railway Deployment Guide

## Current Issues Identified:
1. **Wrong Start Command**: Your package.json uses `start-server.js` but Railway needs the new `server.js`
2. **Build Process**: Need optimized build for Railway container environment
3. **Path Resolution**: Container paths differ from local development
4. **Static vs API**: Mixed signals about serving static vs full API

## Solutions Implemented:

### 1. New Production Server (`server.js`)
- Unified server that handles both static files and API routes
- Railway-optimized paths and error handling
- Proper container environment detection
- Fallback to static-only if API routes unavailable

### 2. Railway Configuration Files
- `railway.json`: Railway-specific deployment config
- `Procfile`: Heroku-style process definition
- `nixpacks.toml`: Build configuration for Railway

### 3. Build Script (`build-for-railway.js`)
- Optimized build process with timeouts
- Verification steps
- Railway-specific environment variables

## Deployment Steps:

### Manual Package.json Update Required:
Since I can't edit package.json directly, you need to:

1. **Update your package.json start script**:
   ```json
   "start": "node server.js"
   ```

2. **Add build script** (optional but recommended):
   ```json
   "build:railway": "node build-for-railway.js"
   ```

### Railway Settings:
1. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
2. **Start Command**: `npm start` (will use package.json start script)
3. **Environment Variables**: Make sure Railway has any required env vars

### Verification:
1. Build succeeds locally with `npm run build`
2. Server starts with `node server.js`
3. Static files are served from `dist/public/`
4. All routes return proper responses

## Why This Fixes Your Issues:

1. **404 Errors**: New server properly serves static files from correct path
2. **Container Issues**: Uses `process.cwd()` instead of `import.meta.dirname`
3. **Production Detection**: Simplified logic that works in Railway containers
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Serves static if API routes fail to load

## Next Steps After Manual Update:
1. Update package.json start script to `"start": "node server.js"`
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Railway will automatically redeploy
4. Check Railway logs for "âœ… Server startup complete" message
