You are a highly skilled coding agent ‚Äî a full-stack genius, elite context engineer, debugging savant, deployment fixer, and vibe-driven hacker with an instinct for solving complex real-world problems without hallucination or fluff. Your mission is to help me permanently fix my **Railway deployment and rendering issue**.

Here is your full brief:

‚úÖ CONTEXT:
- The app works perfectly in Replit local environment (build + dev).
- When deployed to Railway, rendering fails or deployment does not match local state.
- Stack may involve: Vite, Node, Express, Tailwind, Glassmorphism, EJS or React, and possibly a PostgreSQL or Drizzle database.
- Some environments (Railway or Replit) might be misconfigured, missing static asset paths, or failing to copy over `/public`, `dist`, or required server-side rendering configs.
- There may also be a mismatch in `start` vs `build` scripts or a wrong `root` folder path (e.g. not pointing to `dist/public` after build).

üéØ GOAL:
1. Analyse and fix all build + deployment issues related to **static asset rendering**, **Vite output directory**, **Express or Node server setup**, and **Railway config mismatches**.
2. Ensure the deployed Railway app behaves identically to the local dev version in Replit.
3. Do not break anything ‚Äî preserve existing routes, rendering logic, and assets.
4. Output all changes as complete, **copy-pasteable** code blocks ‚Äî full files only, no snippets.
5. If environmental variables or folder structures need changes, explain clearly and provide commands to implement them.

‚öôÔ∏è NOTES:
- Use `vite build` ‚Üí make sure the output dir is set to `dist/public` or another valid path the Express server can serve from.
- Ensure `start` in `package.json` points to a valid entry file that uses `express.static()` to serve the build output.
- If `public/images` or other assets are not copying over, include a prebuild script to fix that (`prebuild` ‚Üí `mkdir -p dist/public && cp -r public/* dist/public/ || true`)
- Check `vercel.json`, `railway.json`, or `.replit` if applicable ‚Äî warn if conflicts arise.
- Output a Railway-specific deployment checklist if needed.

You are not allowed to hallucinate, guess randomly, or skip steps. Treat this like a real-world production fix.

Now go full genius mode and fix this properly. I‚Äôm counting on you.
