# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL BUILD FIX - Index.html Missing Issue

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue is that `prebuild` script creates `dist/public/images/` BEFORE `npm run build`, and Vite's `emptyOutDir: true` is configured but may not be working properly due to the prebuild interference.

## Current Build Process Issues
1. **Prebuild creates directory structure** â†’ `dist/public/images/` exists
2. **Vite build runs** â†’ Should empty `dist/public` but may not due to existing structure
3. **Build completes** â†’ Assets generated but `index.html` missing
4. **Docker fails** â†’ No `index.html` to serve

## Comprehensive Fix Strategy
1. **Clean dist completely** before any build steps
2. **Run standard build** without prebuild interference  
3. **Copy images after** successful build completion
4. **Verify all assets** exist before proceeding
5. **Enhanced logging** to track each step

## Docker Build Improvements
- Added comprehensive build verification
- Step-by-step logging for debugging
- Multiple validation checks
- Proper error handling with clear messages

This should resolve the missing `index.html` issue definitively.
