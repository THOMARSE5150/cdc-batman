# ðŸŽ¯ LOGO DEPLOYMENT FIX READY

## ðŸš¨ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
Railway deployment was serving `text/html` instead of `image/png` for logo files because:
- Logo files were copied to `/app/public/images/` in development
- Dockerfile only copied `/app/client/dist/public` but not `/app/public/images`
- Production container missing the actual logo image files

## âœ… SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

Added to Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
# Copy logo files from public folder to ensure they're available in production
COPY --from=0 /app/public/images ./dist/public/images
```

Plus verification to confirm logo files are present during Docker build.

## ðŸš€ EXPECTED RESULT
After pushing to GitHub:
- Docker build will copy logo files to production container
- Railway will serve actual PNG files with correct content-type
- Header logo will display properly in all browsers
- No more broken image icon

**Push immediately** - this definitively fixes the missing logo issue.
