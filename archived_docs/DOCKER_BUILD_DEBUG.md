# üîç DOCKER BUILD PATH DEBUGGING

## üö® ISSUE IDENTIFIED

The Docker build failure is caused by **path resolution conflicts**:

1. **vite.config.ts**: `outDir: path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "dist/public")`
2. **package.json**: `"build": "vite build --outDir dist/public"`
3. **Container vs Local**: Different path resolution in Docker container

## üõ†Ô∏è DEBUG APPROACH

Updated Dockerfile with comprehensive logging to identify:
- Where Vite is actually building files
- What paths exist after build
- Why `ls: dist/: No such file or directory`

## üîß EXPECTED FINDINGS

The enhanced logging will show us:
- Current working directory in container
- All files/directories after build
- Exact location of built assets
- Path resolution differences

## ‚ö° QUICK FIX READY

Once we see the debug output, we can:
1. Update the COPY commands in Dockerfile
2. Fix the path resolution issue
3. Ensure static files are in the right location

This debugging will give us the exact fix needed for Railway deployment.
