# Railway Deployment Fix Instructions

## Issue
Railway deployment showing blank page due to static file serving issues.

## Solution
Replace these 2 files in your GitHub repository with the fixed versions below:

### 1. Replace `server/index.ts` with this fixed version:

The key change is in the production static file serving section around line 139-156:

```typescript
  if (isProduction) {
    console.log(`Production mode: serving static files`);
    // Fix path for both local and Railway deployment
    const isInDist = process.cwd().endsWith('/dist');
    const publicPath = isInDist 
      ? path.resolve(process.cwd(), "public")
      : path.resolve(process.cwd(), "dist", "public");
    
    console.log(`Working directory: ${process.cwd()}`);
    console.log(`Static files path: ${publicPath}`);
    console.log(`Directory exists: ${fs.existsSync(publicPath)}`);
    if (fs.existsSync(publicPath)) {
      console.log(`Files in public:`, fs.readdirSync(publicPath).slice(0, 5));
    }
    
    app.use(express.static(publicPath));
    app.use("*", (_req, res) => {
      const indexPath = path.resolve(publicPath, "index.html");
      console.log(`Serving index.html from: ${indexPath}`);
      res.sendFile(indexPath);
    });
  } else {
    await setupVite(app, server);
  }
```

### 2. Alternative: Use the simple Railway server

Copy the `railway-server.js` file to your repository and update the start script in package.json to use it:

```json
"start": "node railway-server.js"
```

## After updating files:
1. Commit and push changes to GitHub
2. Railway will automatically trigger a new deployment
3. The website should load correctly instead of showing blank page

## Expected Railway logs after fix:
```
Railway Production Server Starting...
Working directory: /app
Static files path: /app/dist/public
Directory exists: true
Files in public: [ 'apple-touch-icon.png', 'assets', ...]
ðŸš€ Railway server running on port 3000
```
