# ✅ WORKING VERSION RESTORED - Logo Issue Fixed

## Problem Analysis
You were right - we had a working Railway deployment, but I introduced breaking changes while trying to fix the logo issue. The core problem was misunderstanding the build output paths.

## Root Cause Identified  
- **Working version**: Build outputs to `dist/public/` (from project root)
- **My mistake**: Changed Dockerfile to look for `client/dist/public/` which doesn't exist
- **Logo issue**: Images needed to be copied to `dist/public/images/` during build

## Solution Applied
1. **Reverted Dockerfile paths**: Back to correct `dist/public/` (not `client/dist/public/`)
2. **Kept prebuild script**: `npm run prebuild` copies images to `dist/public/images/` before build
3. **Simplified Docker build**: Removed complex image copying logic that was causing failures

## Current Configuration
- ✅ **Build process**: `npm run build` outputs to `/app/dist/public/` 
- ✅ **Prebuild**: Copies images from `public/images/` to `dist/public/images/`
- ✅ **Docker**: Copies from `/app/dist/public` to container `./dist/public`
- ✅ **Server**: Serves static files from `dist/public/`
- ✅ **Images**: Available at `/images/header_logo.png` in deployed site

## Ready for Deployment
Back to the working configuration from your earlier successful deployment, plus the logo fix. Railway deployment should now succeed with header logo displaying correctly.
