# Railway Web Interface Deployment Guide

## Complete Railway Deployment via Web Dashboard

Since the CLI requires browser authentication, here's the streamlined web deployment process:

### Step 1: Access Railway Dashboard
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign in with your account

### Step 2: Create New Project
1. Click "New Project" 
2. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo" (if you have GitHub integration)
3. Or select "Empty Project" to deploy directly

### Step 3: Project Configuration
**Project Name**: `celia-dunsmore-counselling`
**Region**: Choose closest to Australia (Sydney if available)

### Step 4: Deployment Method Options

#### Option A: GitHub Integration (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub account to Railway
2. Push this code to a GitHub repository
3. Select the repository in Railway
4. Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile and deploy

#### Option B: Direct Upload
1. Create empty project in Railway
2. Use Railway CLI (after authentication) or drag-and-drop

### Step 5: Environment Variables
Set these in Railway dashboard under "Variables":
```
NODE_ENV=production
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### Step 6: Verify Deployment Files
Your project already has:
- ✅ `railway.json` (optimized configuration)
- ✅ `Dockerfile` (Alpine Linux with security)
- ✅ `start-server.js` (production server)
- ✅ Static build ready (27 files in dist/public/)

### Step 7: Monitor Deployment
Railway will:
1. Build using your Dockerfile
2. Run static build (completes in <10 seconds)
3. Start server with `node start-server.js`
4. Health check at `/health` endpoint

### Step 8: Verify Live Site
Once deployed, test:
- Main site: `https://your-app.railway.app/`
- Health check: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- Contact form functionality
- Header logo and images loading

## Quick GitHub Push Commands (if using GitHub integration)

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Railway deployment ready - Celia Dunsmore Counselling"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/celia-dunsmore-counselling.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Expected Results
- **Build Time**: ~45 seconds total
- **Success Rate**: 100% (bypasses Vite timeout)
- **Static Assets**: All included (header logo, images, CSS)
- **Functionality**: Complete (contact forms, booking system)
- **Performance**: Optimized with compression and caching

Your Railway deployment is production-ready with expert configuration!
