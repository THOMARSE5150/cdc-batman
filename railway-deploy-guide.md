# Railway Deployment Expert Guide

## Current Status Analysis

Your project has Railway configuration but needs optimization. Here's what I found:

### ✅ What's Working
- `railway.json` exists with basic configuration
- Dockerfile implements single-stage build
- Health check endpoint configured at `/health`
- Restart policy with failure handling
- Production server setup in `server.js`

### ⚠️ Issues to Address
1. **Start Command Mismatch**: `package.json` references `start-server.js` but Railway expects `server.js`
2. **Multiple Build Scripts**: Confusing array of build scripts may cause deployment inconsistency
3. **Health Check Timeout**: Current 300s timeout is too long for Railway best practices
4. **Missing Environment Variable Configuration**: Need proper Railway variable mapping

## Railway Best Practices Implementation

### 1. Build Configuration
Railway supports multiple builders:
- **Dockerfile** (recommended for complex apps) ✅ You're using this
- **Nixpacks** (automatic detection)
- **Buildpacks** (Heroku-style)

### 2. Environment Variables
Railway automatically provides:
- `RAILWAY_PORT` → Use as `PORT`
- `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` → production/staging
- `DATABASE_URL` → Database connection string

### 3. Health Checks
- Path: `/health` ✅ You have this
- Timeout: 30s recommended (you have 300s)
- Start period: 45s for build completion
- Retries: 3 maximum

### 4. Sleep Prevention
- Set `sleepApplication: false` for production
- Railway sleeps apps after 10 minutes of inactivity on free tier

### 5. Restart Policy
- `ON_FAILURE` is correct ✅
- 3 retries recommended (you have 10)
- Railway will restart failed deployments automatically

## Recommended Actions

1. **Update railway.json** with optimized configuration
2. **Fix package.json start command** alignment
3. **Optimize Dockerfile** for Railway best practices
4. **Clean up build scripts** to avoid confusion
5. **Test health check endpoint** response time

## Railway Deployment Commands

```bash
# Deploy with Railway CLI
railway login
railway link [project-id]
railway deploy

# Environment management
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set DATABASE_URL=$DATABASE_URL

# Service management
railway status
railway logs
railway restart
```

## Monitoring & Debugging

Railway provides:
- Real-time logs: `railway logs`
- Deployment status: `railway status`
- Environment variables: `railway variables`
- Domain management: `railway domain`

## Next Steps

I'll now implement the optimized configuration and fix the identified issues.
