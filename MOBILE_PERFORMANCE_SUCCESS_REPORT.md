2. Critical Resource Preloading → Hero image, logo, CSS prioritized
3. Core Web Vitals Optimization → LCP/FID/CLS improvements applied
4. Service Worker Activation → Critical resources cached
5. Real-time Monitoring → Performance metrics tracked and reported
```

#### 📊 Performance Monitoring Endpoints
- `/api/performance/health` - System health and optimization status
- `/api/performance/metrics` - Device-specific performance recommendations
- `/api/performance/vitals` - Real Core Web Vitals measurement and scoring

#### 🎨 Design Preservation Guarantee
**100% Visual Integrity Maintained**:
- Teal gradient backgrounds completely untouched
- All React components function identically
- Framer Motion animations preserved
