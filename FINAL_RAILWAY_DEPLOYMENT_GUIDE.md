# Final Railway Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ What I've Fixed for You

Based on Railway's guidance in your screenshot, I've updated your code to match Railway's expectations exactly:

### 1. **Environment Variable Support**
- Updated server to check for `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` (Railway's preferred format)
- Enhanced client configuration to support `VITE_NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` 
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing variables

### 2. **Configuration Alignment**  
- Fixed railway.json, package.json, and Dockerfile mismatches
- Reduced health check timeout to Railway's recommended 30 seconds
- Created production server with proper signal handling

### 3. **Railway-Compatible URL Detection**
- Updated site configuration to prioritize Railway environment variables
- Added fallback detection for different deployment platforms
- Enhanced Google Maps API endpoint with better logging

## üìã Your Next Steps (Follow Railway's Guidance)

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Railway Dashboard
Go to Variables tab and add these exact variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
VITE_NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-railway-app.railway.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
```

### Step 2: Use Railway's Generated Commands
Railway provided these exact commands in your screenshot:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: update environment variables for Next.js"
git push
```

### Step 3: Fix Railway Dashboard Health Check
- Go to Railway Settings ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Health Check Timeout
- Change from "railway.json" to `30`

## üéØ Expected Results

After following these steps:
- ‚úÖ Site loads properly on Railway domain
- ‚úÖ Google Maps display location information correctly  
- ‚úÖ All API calls use the correct Railway URL
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoint responds within 30 seconds
- ‚úÖ No environment variable errors in logs

## üîç Verification Steps

1. **Health Check**: Visit `https://your-railway-app.railway.app/health`
2. **Google Maps**: Test location pages to ensure maps load
3. **Environment**: Check Railway logs for successful variable detection
4. **Site Function**: Verify all pages load without errors

## üöÄ Why This Will Work

Your Railway deployment failed because:
- Environment variables weren't in the format Railway expected
- Health check timeout was too high (300s vs 30s)  
- Configuration files weren't properly aligned

All of these issues are now fixed and your code matches Railway's exact requirements from the screenshot guidance.
