# Test webhook
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/webhooks/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "production verification"}'
```

## Deployment Commands

### For GitHub ‚Üí Railway Integration:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Railway webhook deployment monitoring"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Railway will auto-deploy** from your GitHub repository

### For Direct Railway Deploy:
```bash
railway login
railway link [your-project-id]
railway up
```

## Monitoring and Logs

### Webhook Activity Logs
All webhook events are logged with:
- Event type (deployment, volume_alert)
- Processing duration
- Email delivery status
- Performance metrics

### View Logs in Railway:
```bash
railway logs --follow
```

Look for these log patterns:
```
INFO [WEBHOOK] Railway deployment webhook received: SUCCESS
INFO [EMAIL] Email sent to celiadunsmore@outlook.com: ‚úÖ Deployment SUCCESS
DEBUG [PERF] Performance: railway_webhook_processing took 250ms
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Webhook not receiving events**
   - Verify Railway webhook URL is correct
   - Check domain is accessible from Railway
   - Ensure webhook events are selected

2. **Email notifications not sending**
   - Verify `SENDGRID_API_KEY` environment variable
   - Check `PRACTICE_EMAIL` is set correctly
   - Review application logs for email errors

3. **Invalid signature errors**
   - Ensure `RAILWAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches Railway config
   - Verify secret is properly formatted

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Test webhook endpoint accessibility
curl -I https://your-domain.com/webhooks/railway

# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-domain.com/webhooks/health

# View Railway logs
railway logs --tail 100
```

## Security Features

- **HMAC Signature Validation**: Prevents unauthorized webhook calls
- **Environment Variable Security**: API keys stored securely
- **Error Logging**: Invalid attempts are logged for monitoring
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against webhook spam

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Verify webhook setup** using the test endpoints
2. **Monitor first deployment** to confirm notifications work
3. **Set up database backup monitoring** (future enhancement)
4. **Configure Google Calendar webhooks** for appointment notifications

Your webhook system provides enterprise-grade monitoring for your mental health platform. You'll have complete visibility into deployment status and proactive alerts for any issues.
