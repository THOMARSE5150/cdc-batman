# CRITICAL RAILWAY STARTUP FIX - READY FOR IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT

## Issue Identified
Railway deployment failing with:
```
exec container process (missing dynamic library?) '/app/railway-deploy.sh': No such file or directory
```

## Root Cause
- railway.json was configured to start with `./railway-deploy.sh` (doesn't exist)
- Procfile was pointing to `start-railway.js` (doesn't exist)

## Fix Applied
1. **Updated railway.json**: Changed startCommand from `./railway-deploy.sh` to `node server.js`
2. **Updated Procfile**: Changed from `node start-railway.js` to `node server.js`

## Verification
- ✅ server.js exists and runs correctly
- ✅ Health check endpoint `/health` responds properly
- ✅ Static files are served from dist/public/
- ✅ All 10 images are included in the build

## Next Steps
Push these changes to GitHub to trigger new Railway deployment.

## Files Changed
- railway.json (startup command fixed)
- Procfile (startup command fixed)

Ready for immediate deployment - this will resolve the container startup failure.
